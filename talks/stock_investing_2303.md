#### Course Information

In this courese, I will teach students fundemental concenpts of computer vision. I expect students can understand a few important topics in computer vision such as image processing, segmentation, recognition, detection, computational photography, motion estimation and structure from motion. Through discussion in the class and implemention for projects, students should learn concepts and first-hand experience of applying computer vision knowledges for real-world applications.
