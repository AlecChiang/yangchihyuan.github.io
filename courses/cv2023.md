#### Course Information

In this courese, I will teach students fundemental concenpts of computer vision. I expect students can understand a few important topics in computer vision such as image processing, segmentation, recognition, detection, computational photography, motion estimation and structure from motion. Through discussion in the class and implemention for projects, students should learn concepts and first-hand experience of applying computer vision knowledges for real-world applications.

The course consists of four programming projects and one final gruop project (max 5 members each team). Please find information about final project in the syllabus.

#### Prerequisites

This course requires programming experience (mainly Python) as well as linear algebra, basic calculus, and basic probability. Previous knowledge of visual computing will be helpful.

#### Grading
Your final grade will be made up from
- 60% 4 programming projects
- 35% final projects (includes proposal, project pitch, midtern report, final project presentation, and final project report). 5 member each group maximum (Project Ideas)
- 5% class participation
You will lose 10% each day for late projects. However, you have three "late days" for the whole course. That is to say, the first 24 hours after the due date and time counts as 1 day, up to 48 hours is two and 72 for the third late day. This will not be reflected in the initial grade reports for your assignment, but they will be factored in and distributed at the end of the semester so that you get the most points possible.
