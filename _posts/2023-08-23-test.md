Taipei Zoo to hold memorial for deceased animals during Ghost Month

Taipei, Aug. 18 (CNA) A memorial dedicated to animals that recently passed away at Taipei Zoo will be held during Ghost Month with members of the public invited to write down their feelings about the animals, many of whom were family favorites, an official said Friday.

The zoo decided to expand the scope of the memorial, which will take place from Aug. 20-30, in the wake of the deaths of several well-known animals over the past year, said Director of Taipei Zoo Chen Yi-tsung (諶亦聰) in a press release.

Themed "Learning from Life," the memorial welcomes zoo visitors to leave messages next to a park monument, she said.
